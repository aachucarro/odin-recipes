    <p>Looking for a tasty, low-cost, and simple recipe to serve? This delectable Paraguayan Chipa Guazú “Corn Souffle” Recipe is a must-try! 
        The Chipa Guazu is a traditional corn soufflé from Paraguay.
        It’s crispy on the outside but moist and tender on the inside, 
        with a flavor that no other dish can match</p>
    <p>It’s ideal for large family gatherings as an appetizer or side dish. 
        The ingredients are nearly identical to those used in our Authentic Chipa Guazú recipe</p>
        <h2>What we need?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>CORN!</li>
            <h3>How we make it?</h3>
        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Generously butter a 9 by 13-inch baking dish and dust with cornmeal.</li>
            <li>In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, melt the butter. Add the chopped onions and salt, cook until soft and transparent, about 5 to 10 minutes.
                 Remove skillet from heat and set aside to cool off.</li>
            <li>Place the eggs, sugar, and milk in a blender or food processor and blend for 3 minutes. 
                Add the corn and blend for about 30 seconds, just enough to break up the corn kernels, do not over-blend!</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the corn mixture, cheese, cornmeal, and cook onions until well combined. Transfer the batter for the Chipa Guazu to the prepared baking dish. Bake the Chipa Guazu until golden brown, about 50 to 60 minutes, or a cake tester comes out clean</li>
        </ol>
